<?php
// A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each of the words consists of only uppercase and lowercase English letters (no punctuation).

// For example, "Hello World", "HELLO", and "hello world hello world" are all sentences.
// You are given a sentence s​​​​​​ and an integer k​​​​​​. You want to truncate s​​​​​​ such that it contains only the first k​​​​​​ words. Return s​​​​​​ after truncating it.



// Example 1:

// Input: s = "Hello how are you Contestant", k = 4
// Output: "Hello how are you"
// Explanation:
// The words in s are ["Hello", "how" "are", "you", "Contestant"].
// The first 4 words are ["Hello", "how", "are", "you"].
// Hence, you should return "Hello how are you".
// Example 2:

// Input: s = "What is the solution to this problem", k = 4
// Output: "What is the solution"
// Explanation:
// The words in s are ["What", "is" "the", "solution", "to", "this", "problem"].
// The first 4 words are ["What", "is", "the", "solution"].
// Hence, you should return "What is the solution".
// Example 3:

// Input: s = "chopper is not a tanuki", k = 5
// Output: "chopper is not a tanuki"


// Constraints:

// 1 <= s.length <= 500
// k is in the range [1, the number of words in s].
// s consist of only lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces.
// The words in s are separated by a single space.
// There are no leading or trailing spaces.
